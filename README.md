# GCNv2 SLAM

## Introduction
GCNv2 is a high-throughput variant of the Geometric Correspondence Network for performing RGB-D SLAM online on embedded platforms. We trained the binary descriptor in the same format with ORB (32 bytes) for the convenience of integration. In this implementation, we evaluate the motion estimation using a system built on top the [ORB-SLAM2], (https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2). Thanks to the robustness of ORB-SLAM2, our system is able to achive reliable tracking perfomance on our drone platform in real-time.

# Dependencies

## C++11 or C++0x Compiler
We use the new thread and chrono functionalities of C++11.

## Pytorch
We use [Pytorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) C++ api(libtorch) for deloying the GCNv2. The libtorch can be built as follows:
```
pip install typing
git clone --recursive -b v1.0.1 https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch
cd pytorch && mkdir build && cd build
python ../tools/build_libtorch.py
```
The built libtorch library is located at ```pytorch/torch/lib/tmp_install/``` by default.

**Required at least 1.0.1. Lower version of pytorch has cuDNN linking issue:https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/14033#issuecomment-455046353.**

## Pangolin
We use [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) for visualization and user interface. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin.

## OpenCV
We use [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) to manipulate images and features. Dowload and install instructions can be found at: http://opencv.org. 

**Required at least 2.4.3. Tested with OpenCV 2.4.11 and OpenCV 3.2**.

**NOTE: If you use ROS this will most likely be installed**.

## Eigen3
Required by g2o (see below). Download and install instructions can be found at: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org. 

**Required at least 3.1.0**.

**Note: If you use ROS this is most likely already installed**.

## DBoW2 and g2o (Included in Thirdparty folder)
We use modified versions of the [DBoW2](https://github.com/dorian3d/DBoW2) library to perform place recognition and [g2o](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o) library to perform non-linear optimizations. Both modified libraries (which are BSD) are included in the *Thirdparty* folder. 

**Note: You do not need to install these, they will be built as part of GCNv2-SLAM**.

# Preparation
Clone the code
```
git clone https://github.com/jiexiong2016/GCNv2_SLAM.git
```
Then build the project 
```
cd GCNv2_SLAM
./build.sh
```
Make sure to edit `build.sh` pointing to your local libtorch installation. 

Edit `run.sh` to check out how to run with GCNv2 or vanilla ORB.
